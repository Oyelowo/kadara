# kadara
An all-in-one distributed databases(relational, columnar, document, graph), object and block storage, event bus, kv-store with consistent high-level APIs and toolings with a focus on DevEx.

For vast majority of Software, you typically need one or some of these. The key is to 
build all on same unified foundation that allows for intutive ease of use from testing
locally without mocking to single instance to distributed fault-tolerant system.

Building them all in rust allows for ease of use embedded and ease of deployment and distribution
for use in other languages.
